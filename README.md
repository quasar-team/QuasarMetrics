QuasarMetrics
-------------
By Piotr Nikiel <piotr@nikiel.info>

QuasarMetrics is a simple tool to obtain software engineering metrics
about a quasar-based project.

The metrics which you might be interested in are:
* nND - non-developer-modifiable design-dependent code in ELoCs,
* nD - developer design-dependent code in ELoCs,
* nGS - generated stubs in ELoCs,
* nIC - intermediate code in ELoCs

from that automation ratio for whole design-dependent code can be obtained.

More documentation on it can be available on request to piotr.nikiel@cern.ch
